This site is a starting point for anyone who wants to discover the Alpstein Mountains. The key point is to give a brief overview about the history and geology, show the beautiful landscapes and give some advice for hiking tours.

## UX & Design
The overall design is based on a clear, sleek design with minimalistic colors to make sure, the content speaks for itself.

This site has been built with the "mobile first" approach in mind. This results in a very responsive and easy to navigate site, independet of the medium, which is used to access it.

### Color Scheme
The colors chosen for this site follow the natural colors of the landscapes shown in the images. Colors are minimalistic and supportive, but do not distrub the look of the images.
I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/f7f7f2-e4e6c3-a8b39c-222725-121113) to choose a visually appealing set of colors.

### Typography
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to choose and import clear and appealing fonts. "EB Garamond" for headers and "Playfair Display" for text. "Serif" acts as a backup font.

### Wireframes
As an initial step, before any code has been written, I have used Balsamiq to create a Mobile and a Desktop version of each site.
