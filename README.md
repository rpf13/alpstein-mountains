### __Color Scheme__
The colors chosen for this site should follow the natural colors of the landscapes shown in the images. Colors should be minimalistic but supportive and not distrub the look of the images.
I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/f7f7f2-e4e6c3-a8b39c-222725-121113) to choose a visually appealing set of colors.

### __Typography__
I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to choose and import clear and appealing fonts. "EB Garamond" for headers and "Playfair Display" for text. "Serif" acts as a backup font.
